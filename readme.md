SECTION ONE:
define security 
security analysis : monitoring and response on attack, prevent hack from attacking 
transferable skill : 
    - communication, 
    - collaboration, 
    - analysis complete, 
    - problem solving
technical skill:
 - programming language 
 - security information and event management  'S.I.E.M'
Data breach: 
personal identify information PII
sensitive personal identify information S_PII
PII and S_PII is the primary info attacker looking for

SECTION 2:
Virus : malicious code written to interfere with  computer operations and cause damage to data and software ,worm can be duplicate and spread out 
Malware : software designed to harm devices or network
social engineer: a manipulation technique that exploits humans error to gain private info , access, or valuables - need training to prevent attack 

CERTs exist after two big incident about virus and malware cost billion of dollar

Two notable attack:
Love letter attack case
Phishing: the use  of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software -> 
Equifax breach case


C_I_SSP has defined eight domain that need 
1. Security and risk management: focus on Defines security goals and objectives risk mitigation, business continuity and the law
2. Asset security: security digital and physical assets, it's also related to the storage, maintenance retention and destruction of data
3. Security architecture and engineering: optimized data security by ensuring effective tools, systems , and processes are in place  -- firewall
4. communication and network engineering: manage and secure physical networks and wireless communications
network policies 
5. identity and access management: Keeps data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as networks and applications
6. security assessment and testing : conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities
7. security operation: conducting investigation and implementing preventative measures
8. software development security: uses secure coding practices, which area a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services

Security frameworks and control:
- security framework are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy
  - protecting PII
  - securing financial information
  - identifying security weaknesses
  - managing organizational risks
  - Aligning security with business goals
- Frameworks has Four core components:
  - Goals
  - Guidelines
  - Processes
  - communication
- components of security frameworks
  - identifying and documenting security goals
  - setting guidelines to achieve security goals
  - Implementing strong security processes
  - monitoring and communicate results
- security controls:
  - safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks
CIA triad: (COnfidentially Integrity Availability)
  - a foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies
  - Confidentially: only authorized users can access specific assets or data
  - Integrity: Data is correct, authentic, and reliable
  - Availability: Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it
  - Asset : an item perceived as having value to an organization
NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF):
  - A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk 
Ethical principles in security: 
  - confidentiality
  - Privacy protection : means safeguarding personal information form unauthorized use
  - Laws are rules that are recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity
Important programming tools:
- SIEM tools : Security information and event management tools : an application that collects and analyses log data to monitor critical activities in an organization
  - splunk is a data analysis platform
  - chronicle is a cloud native (fast delivery of new feature) sime tool that stores securities data for search and analysis
- playbooks : a manual that provides details about any operational action 
- network protocol analyzers (packets sniffer) : a tool designed to capture adn analyze data traffic within a network
- Linux operating system : open source 
- programming languages
  - python: used to perform tasks that are repetitive and time consuming and that require a high level of detail and accuracy
  - sql: a programming language used to create interact with and request information from a database (an organize collection of data)
- Log : a recode of events that occur within an organization's systems
How To Manage Security Risks and Threats:
1. CISSP's eight security domains:
  1. security posture : an organization's ability to manage is defense of critical assets and data adn react to change
  2. security and risk management: Focused on defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and legal regulation
    - Risk mitigation: the process of having the right procedures and rules in places to quickly reduce the impact of a risk like a breach  
    - Business continuity : an organization's ability to maintain their everyday productivity by establishing risk disaster recovery plans 
  - asset security : focused on securing digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data
  - Security Architecture and engineering
  3. Security frameworks and controls : Focused on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, stems, and processes are in place to protect an organization's assets and data
  - Shared Responsibility: All individuals within an organization take an activee rle in lowering risk and maintaining both physical and virtual security
  4. Communication and network security : focused on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communication
security audits
Basic security Tools
