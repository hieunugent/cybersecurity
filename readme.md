SECTION ONE:
define security 
security analysis : monitoring and response on attack, prevent hack from attacking 
transferable skill : 
    - communication, 
    - collaboration, 
    - analysis complete, 
    - problem solving
technical skill:
 - programming language 
 - security information and event management  'S.I.E.M'
Data breach: 
personal identify information PII
sensitive personal identify information S_PII
PII and S_PII is the primary info attacker looking for

SECTION 2:
Virus : malicious code written to interfere with  computer operations and cause damage to data and software ,worm can be duplicate and spread out 
Malware : software designed to harm devices or network
social engineer: a manipulation technique that exploits humans error to gain private info , access, or valuables - need training to prevent attack 

CERTs exist after two big incident about virus and malware cost billion of dollar

Two notable attack:
Love letter attack case
Phishing: the use  of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software -> 
Equifax breach case


C_I_SSP has defined eight domain that need 
1. Security and risk management: focus on Defines security goals and objectives risk mitigation, business continuity and the law
2. Asset security: security digital and physical assets, it's also related to the storage, maintenance retention and destruction of data
3. Security architecture and engineering: optimized data security by ensuring effective tools, systems , and processes are in place  -- firewall
4. communication and network engineering: manage and secure physical networks and wireless communications
network policies 
5. identity and access management: Keeps data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as networks and applications
6. security assessment and testing : conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities
7. security operation: conducting investigation and implementing preventative measures
8. software development security: uses secure coding practices, which area a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services

Security frameworks and control:
- security framework are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy
  - protecting PII
  - securing financial information
  - identifying security weaknesses
  - managing organizational risks
  - Aligning security with business goals
- Frameworks has Four core components:
  - Goals
  - Guidelines
  - Processes
  - communication
- components of security frameworks
  - identifying and documenting security goals
  - setting guidelines to achieve security goals
  - Implementing strong security processes
  - monitoring and communicate results
- security controls:
  - safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks

Ethics of security:
